# prophet_extension

Toy version of FB Prophet to handle Hierarchical Time Series models in a Bayesian Inference framework. 


# TODOs

1. Jupyter notebook by following and cleaning up  `prophet_visnights.py`
2.  Build slides
3. Hierarchical stan checks
    * Non-cenetered parameterization?
4. Check Map estimation in stan vs MCMC
    * MAP estimation -> optimization (model.optimize())
